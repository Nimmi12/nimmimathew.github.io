I'm a software engineer living in Toronto,Canada. 

I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering and  have 2.5 years of experience in software development. I was working as an ROR developer in [Ruby Software](http://www.ruby-software.com/), Trivandrum, India

Then I moved to Canada to pursue my studies. I specialized in software engineering and Technology in [Centennial College](https://www.centennialcollege.ca/). During my course I got opportunity to work as a Technical systems analysts in [RBC](https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/personal.html) for about 9 months, as part of my co-op. I mainly worked on Java and Angular.

I'm passionate about coding and I enjoy it to the fullest when I use Ruby and Rails for coding.
